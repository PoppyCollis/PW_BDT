Important assumptions made in Locke

1. The concept behind computing a separate sensitivity parameter for confidence is that ad-
ditional noise may have been applied to the internal measurement between the Type 1 and
Type 2 decisions (Maniscalco and Lau, 2016).

2. Initial d prime fit assumes unit variance on likelihod distributions.

3. assume unit variance of the meta d prime too and that they are equally distributed from one another. 

does 0.5 probability in extrema cases make sense for metad when I am looking at areas A, B, C and D?
